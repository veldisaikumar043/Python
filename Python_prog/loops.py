# DIFFERENCE B/W FOR & WHILE LOOP
# FOR LOOP:
# -It is used when the number of iterations is known.
# -In case of no condition, the loop is repeated infinite times.
# WHILE LOOP:
# -It is used when the number of iterations is not known.
# -In case of no condition, an error will be shown.

# & operator
# & is a bitwise operator used in the Python language. It basically
# acts on various bits and performs operations bit by bit.
# Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1

# x = 10 (0000 1010)
# y = 4  (0000 0100)
# x&y=0  (0000 0000)

# | operator
# Sets each bit to 1 if one of two bits is 1
# x = 10 (0000 1010)
# y = 4  (0000 0100)
# x|y=14 (0000 1110)
