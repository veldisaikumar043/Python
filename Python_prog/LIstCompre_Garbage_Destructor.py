# LIST COMPREHENSION
# Python List comprehension provides a much more short syntax for
# creating a new list based on the values of an existing list.
# Syntax
# newList = [ expression(element) for element in oldList if condition ]

#  TO PRINT 2 to 20
# lst=[]
# lst=[x for x in range(1,21) if x%2==0]
# print(lst)

# GARBAGE COLLECTION
# Python deletes unwanted objects (built-in types or class instances) automatically
# to free the memory space. The process by which Python periodically frees and reclaims
#  blocks of memory that no longer are in use is called Garbage Collection.

# DESTRUCTOR
# -Destructors are called when an object gets destroyed. In Python, destructors are not
#  needed as much as in C++ because Python has a garbage collector that handles memory
#  management automatically.
# -The __del__() method is a known as a destructor method in Python. It is called when
#  references to the object have been deleted i.e when an object is garbage collected.
